# RHT-Right-Ahead-Time


A JIT compiler is a clever mechanism that preserves interpreter flexibility while providing noticeable runtime performance improvements. A more advanced approach is a hybrid JIT compiler, which divides code into hot and cold paths. Cold (simple) parts are executed by the interpreter, while hot (frequently executed or tight) paths are JIT-compiled. This reduces runtime overhead, but it still introduces execution delays due to warm-up and memory costs associated with runtime compilation. In my view, a JIT compiler is not a “real compiler” in the traditional sense—it behaves more like an interpreter tree augmented with runtime specialization.

Have you ever considered turning a JIT into a true compiler? Here’s my idea:

A traditional JIT compiler compiles and executes programs at runtime, generating machine code for hot paths. But what if we decoupled compilation from execution? Imagine a system where the compiler analyzes the program ahead of time, determines which parts should be interpreted and which should be compiled, and pre-compiles machine code accordingly. It effectively performs the work of a JIT compiler without executing the code during compilation, preserving runtime flexibility while eliminating warm-up delays.
